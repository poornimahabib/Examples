        <h2>ABOUT/</h2>
            Sexual Harassment has been outlawed by the Govt. of
            India in 2013, through SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF
            WOMEN AT WORKPLACE, (PREVENTION, PROHIBITION
            AND REDRESSAL) ACT, 2013. The Act states that Sexual
            Harassment results in violation of the fundamental rights
            of a woman to equality under Article 14 and 15 of the
            Constitution of India and her right to life and live with
            dignity under article 21 of the constitution.
            Any organization with ten or more employees need to
            set up an Internal Committee (IC). It is mandatory that
            there are awareness sessions for men and women, IC is
            skilled and trained and then the reporting in the annual
            report as well as to the District officer is timely.
            Many organizations use the checklist approach which is
            not aimed at really bringing the desired change. This is
            because most often organizations don’t know how to
            start and to work on the Act, and many a times, it is not
            an organizational priority.

                What our customers are saying about us
                Pari ni t ha R am pras ad
                HR Manager
                GreedyGame Media Pvt Ltd
                I approached Sage Sustainability in October 2017 for setting up POSH in our
                startup - GreedyGame. Their commitment in terms of guiding us, taking us
                through all the procedures and training the staff is commendable. Shashi
                Ma'am is one the most professional and polite entrepreneurs that I have had
                the privilege to work with. Her continuous guidance is extremely helpful and
                an eye opener to today's ever concerning issues with sexual harassment. I
                wish Sage Sustainability all the very best in all their endeavors.
